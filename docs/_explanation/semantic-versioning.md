# Semantic Versioning

This repository uses [Semantic Versioning] to manage the versioning of the LiftButton software releases.

## Versioning Scheme

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:
- **MAJOR** version is incremented when there are incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version is incremented when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version is incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.

[Semantic Versioning]: https://semver.org/
