# Lift Button

Write the brains of a lift button. 
- When you press the button, the light comes on. 
- When the lift arrives and the doors
open, the light goes out. 
- Pressing the button again while the light is on but the lift doors are closed has no effect.
- While the doors are open, pressing the button does not switch the light on.
